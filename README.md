## What is Diversity?

__Diversity__ is generally defined as the differences among individuals in a group that might cause us to be treated differently in society. 

### Why should I care?

Harvey Mudd, just like any other college, is a diverse place with students who come from varying backgrounds and a range of identities, from ethnicty to gender to family status. As a result, we often have conversations that touch on students' unique experience at this school. Developing a level of __cultural competency__ allows us to better understand the feelings, experiences, and ideas of others around us and see how they might experience something in a completely different way from us.
